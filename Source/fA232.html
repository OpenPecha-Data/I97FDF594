	<h2>Unravelling Mantraâs Meaning in The Heart of Wisdom SÅ«tra<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></h2>
<p><strong><em>by ÅrÄ« Siá¹ha</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Homage to blessed Vairocana and the buddhas.<br/>
Homage to the two mothers.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
Homage to the saá¹gha, the supreme assembly.<br/>
In all of you, I take refuge!</em></p>
<p><em>So that beings may be lovingly cared for,<br/>
And never cut off from compassion,<br/>
I will extract from the sÅ«tra of the three transmissions<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a><br/>
The Secret Mantra meaning.<br/>
I will explain it to those with excellence and fortune,<br/>
And withhold it from those who cling to logic.</em> </p>
<p>The sÅ«traâs opening phrase, â<strong>thus have I heard at one time</strong>,â addresses the chronological background of the teaching. The phrase reveals that the teaching took place at this particular point and no other and that the teaching is not an expression of personal, immediate cognition, but that it was <strong>heard</strong> from someone else. This phrase also suggests that the compiler was well-practiced in listening and memorization. â<strong>Time</strong>â here alludes to the particular time when the Buddhaâs main disciples had assembled. Specifically, the phrase â<strong>at one time</strong>â emphasizes that the teaching was not given many times or spread over several occasions. It was given once, at this <strong>one time</strong>, when all the main disciples were present.</p>
<p>â<strong>Blessed One</strong>â is an epithet for our teacher. Generally, <strong>Blessed One</strong><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> means one who has conquered the four mÄras or demons, holds the six perfections, and has transcended all wrong understandings. On a deeper level, <strong>Blessed One</strong> signifies the conquest of all appearance and existence, such as the five aggregates, within the state of the deity. In understanding the nature of reality, the Blessed One has transcended all objects of fixation. Ultimately, <strong>Blessed One</strong> means the effortless conquest of all phenomena of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a, within their essential nature. Such a one thereby holds the great self-knowing wisdom. Since this wisdom has no essential existence, the <strong>Blessed One</strong> has transcended all confines of dualistic perception, reaching the point where even the notions âsaá¹sÄraâ and ânirvÄá¹aâ do not remain.</p>
<p>The phrase, â<strong>in RÄjgá¹ha at Vulture Peak mountain</strong>â indicates the specific place in which the teaching was given. The outer site of the teaching was <strong>Vulture Peak</strong>, resembling a mountain of jewels, within <strong>RÄjgá¹ha</strong>, the eastern part of Magadha, the domain of the King BimbisÄra. It is said that all buddhas reside on this circular, stÅ«pa-shaped <strong>mountain</strong>, and thus it is most exalted among all mountains. The inner site of the teaching is Akaniá¹£á¹­haâ<em>Above All</em>âso called because it has not fallen under the sway of form, characteristics, or fixation. The secret site of the teaching is awareness itself, the heart of the awakened mind, the site wherein the entirety of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a is contained.</p>
<p>The phrase, â<strong>together with a great community of monks and a great community of bodhisattvas</strong>â describes the retinue present at the time of the teaching. The outer retinue are: <strong>monks</strong> who aspire and have interest, and thus abide in virtuous qualities; a <strong>great community</strong> of beings who observe meditation, maintain the view and are bodhisattva aspirants; and <strong>bodhisattvas</strong> who have the power to benefit others. All these as well as others are gathered together, forming a single retinue. The inner retinue are a saá¹bhogakÄya beings, such as the buddhas of the five families. The secret retinue is the indivisible essence of self-knowing wisdom. The Dharma should be taught in such a situation. The Dharma, likewise, can be divided into outer, inner, and secret. The outer Dharma is the Dharma to be trained in, such as the ten virtuous deeds. The inner Dharma is the Dharma of the MahÄyÄna. The secret Dharma is the wisdom that is awareness.</p>
<p>â<strong>At that time, the Blessed One entered an absorption on categories of phenomena called âperception of the profoundâ.</strong>â<br/>
This means that <strong>at that time,</strong> when the five excellences<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> were present and when it was time for maturing the retinue, <strong>the Blessed One remained</strong> without conceptual focus in <strong>an absorption on categories of phenomena</strong>âi.e., the outer, inner and secret phenomena. He thereby perceived <strong>the profound</strong> meaning, the non-existence of real phenomena, in other words profound emptiness. The outer <strong>absorption</strong> is supported by concrete things, the inner is devoid of entities, and the secret makes no such distinctions.</p>
<p>The text continues:<br/>
â<strong>At the same time, noble AvalokiteÅvara, the bodhisattva and great being, beheld the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom, and saw that the five aggregates are empty of nature...</strong>â<br/>
As our teacher remained within the disengaged state of dharmatÄ, AvalokiteÅvaraâthe foremost amongst his retinueâalso came to rest in that same state. On the outer level, <strong>bodhisattva</strong> refers to someone who is on the stages of trainings; inwardly, it refers to someone who is on the ten bhÅ«mis. Secretly, it refers to the heart-essence itself. The one who embodies these three levels is called <strong>great being</strong>. Alternatively, we can understand <strong>bodhisattva</strong> to refer to mastery for oneâs own benefit, and <strong>great being</strong> to mastery for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>Generally, <strong>noble</strong> refers to one who has risen high above the afflictions and the mire of saá¹sÄra. On a deeper level, it refers to the saá¹bhogakÄya retinue. Ultimately, it refers to the essence of awareness, the dharmakÄya.</p>
<p><strong>AvalokiteÅvara</strong>, or â<strong>the lord who sees</strong>,â has realized the ultimate meaning for his own benefit. He now <strong>gazes</strong> (<strong>avalokita</strong>) upon others to enact their benefit which shows that he is able to teach disciples of whatever inclination. He is therefore the <strong>lord</strong> (<strong>iÅvara</strong>) of both self and other, or of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a. This is the meaning of his name.</p>
<p>Through <strong>insight</strong> into the scriptures, one can teach the ways of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a, and through <strong>insight</strong> into reasoning one resolves their ultimate meaning. Through <strong>insight</strong> beyond reference, one makes no distinctions whatsoever, anywhere at all, and so one has <strong>gone beyond</strong> saá¹sÄra. One has also <strong>gone beyond</strong> the freedom from suffering that is nirvÄá¹a, and so compassion naturally bursts forth. This perfection of wisdom or âinsight gone beyondâ is <strong>profound</strong> because its essence cannot be shown as anything at all, it is difficult to teach, and it transcends causes and conditions. <strong>Practice</strong> is the comprehension of this meaning. And so, the practice is <strong>looking</strong> at reality, again and again, without conceptually focusing on anything.</p>
<p>The object to be looked at are the <strong>aggregates</strong> determined as <strong>five</strong> in number. On a general level, <strong>the five aggregates</strong> are form, sensation, recognition, conditioning factors and consciousness. On a deeper level <strong>the five aggregates</strong> are the buddhas of the five families; and, the five qualities of the five aggregates are the five unsurpassable wisdoms. Thus, <strong>the five aggregates</strong> are pure in essence. Intellectually contemplating the <strong>aggregates</strong> as pure is the way of those in training. Naturally seeing them as pure is the realization of the meaning.</p>
<p>The true meaning here to be understood is the <strong>empty</strong> quality of reality. This is not dependent emptiness, which is the absence of one thing in another. The emptiness of non-existence is like the essence of awareness and so on; the emptiness brought about by fourfold destruction is the subtlest particle of matter; and natural emptiness is the essential meaning, the absence of any real entity or conceptual focus. Of these, the wisdom beyond conceptual reference is the meaning of <strong>seeing</strong>.</p>
<p>Now comes the question that ÅÄriputra puts to AvalokiteÅvara:<br/>
â<strong>Then, through the Buddha's power, venerable ÅÄriputra said to noble AvalokiteÅvara, the bodhisattva and great being: âHow should a child of noble family who wishes to practise the profound perfection of wisdom train?â</strong>â<br/>
The text specifies âthrough the power of the Buddhaâ because it is <strong>through the Buddha</strong> ÅÄkyamuniâs <strong>power</strong> that AvalokiteÅvara was liberated and that ÅÄriputra gained the courage to ask his question. ÅÄriputra is <strong>venerable</strong> or âyouthfulâ because he has attained the ever-youthful deathless state, free from birth and death. <strong>Child of noble family</strong> refers to someone who has completely abandoned any other family or status and joined the family of Buddha ÅÄkyamuni. The reason why he asked this question is to benefit sentient beings.</p>
<p>The question asked is this: If a son or daughter <strong>of noble family</strong> who aspires to the MahÄyÄna <strong>wishes to practice the profound</strong> meaning of the <strong>perfection of wisdom</strong> of the unobservable, just like AvalokiteÅvara, how should they <strong>train</strong>, and what methods should they use?</p>
<p>Then, â<strong>the noble AvalokiteÅvara, the bodhisattva and great being, replied to venerable ÅÄriputra as follows</strong>â and thus began the teaching:<br/>
â<strong>âO ÅÄriputra, a son of noble family or daughter of noble family who wishes to practise the profound perfection of wisdom should regard things in this wayâ</strong>â In other words, âaspirants belonging to the MahÄyÄna family, be they male, female, or otherwise, who wish to follow my example and practice wisdom beyond reference, should train in this wayâ¦â</p>
<p>â<strong>They should see the five aggregates to be empty of nature.</strong>â<br/>
âSince <strong>the five</strong> ordinary <strong>aggregates</strong> and so forth have always been primordially empty, they should be viewed as <strong>empty of nature</strong>, just as I, AvalokiteÅvara, view them!â AvalokiteÅvara said this to inspire faith and trust.</p>
<p>Next, the phrase, â<strong>form is emptiness</strong>â identifies the essence of <strong>form</strong> as the nature of emptiness. â<strong>Emptiness is form</strong>â means that, through the unceasing quality of awareness, <strong>emptiness</strong> itself appears as though it were also form. </p>
<p>â<strong>Form is not other than emptiness</strong>â indicates that, apart from this empty form, there is no other phenomena belonging to either saá¹sÄra or nirvÄá¹a that could possibly appear. There is no appearance of <strong>form</strong> other than as the unceasing quality of <strong>emptiness</strong>. </p>
<p>The text now makes explicit mention of the other aggregates. Just as form abides as described above, so should <strong>sensation, recognition, conditioning factors and consciousness</strong> be understood to abide. </p>
<p>The text continues with the phrase, â<strong>âTherefore, ÅÄriputra, all dharmas are emptiness.â</strong>â<br/>
It is being explained to ÅÄriputra that since, as with form, everything in saá¹sÄra is emptiness and lacks concrete existence, it follows that <strong>all phenomena</strong> of nirvÄá¹a are also naturally <strong>emptiness</strong>. The meaning of this emptiness is explained as being without <strong>characteristics</strong> of either form or emptiness; as being <strong>unproduced</strong> by any cause or condition. Its essential quality is being <strong>unimpeded</strong> by anything. It is utterly <strong>untainted</strong> by anything whatsoever. From the very beginning it has never fallen prey to fixation on either subject or object. It is also <strong>not untainted</strong>. This essential meaning can never be <strong>decreased</strong> by conditions and it can likewise never be <strong>increased</strong> by any causes whatsoever. </p>
<p>â<strong>Therefore, ÅÄriputra,</strong>â there is nothing to be practiced or mastered apart from this emptiness that is to be observed. Since <strong>form</strong> itself is <strong>emptiness</strong>, so too <strong>sensation, recognition, conditioning factors and consciousness</strong> are all non-dual. Likewise, the five sense facultiesâ<strong>eye, ear, nose, tongue, body</strong>âthe five perceptual processes, and their five objectsâ<strong>visible form, sound, odour, taste, and texture</strong>âare all nowhere to be found. From the <strong>eye element up to</strong> the <strong>mental consciousness element</strong>, all are without distinction.</p>
<p>In the same way, within this essential meaning there is <strong>no ignorance</strong> and therefore no cause for the <strong>extinction of ignorance</strong>. Within this empty essence there is <strong>no old age</strong> or <strong>death</strong>, and therefore no exhaustion of the interdependent links of birth, old age, sickness, and death. Likewise, there is <strong>no suffering</strong> forged by the five poisons and <strong>no origin</strong> of the state of thorough affliction.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> Thus, there is <strong>no cessation</strong> of suffering into bliss. Furthermore, as there are no entities of saá¹sÄra to be practiced, <strong>neither</strong> is there <strong>a path</strong> leading to nirvÄá¹a; nor are there any paths and bhÅ«mis to be trained in or traversed.</p>
<p>There are <strong>no</strong> conventional five <strong>wisdoms</strong>, for there is <strong>no attainment</strong> other than this essential meaning. Since the five wisdoms have always been present within and of themselves, there is also no reason for <strong>non-attainment</strong>.</p>
<p>â<strong>âTherefore, ÅÄriputra, since bodhisattvas have no attainment, they rely on and abide by the perfection of wisdom.â</strong>â<br/>
Here, ÅÄriputra is told that, since there is no cause of attainment other than the path, there is also <strong>no attainment</strong> other than the fruition. Thus, since the <strong>perfection of wisdom</strong> is beyond reference it is called âthe complete dharma of the essence.â The result, then, is to <strong>rely on and abide by</strong> exactly this!</p>
<p>â<strong>âSince their minds are unobscured, they have no fear. They completely transcend error and reach the ultimate nirvÄá¹a.â</strong>â<br/>
This indicates that the true fruition abides in and of itself, there is nothing apart from this. Thus, there are <strong>no obscuring</strong> factors in the <strong>mind</strong> and, since there is nothing to be attained elsewhere, there is also <strong>no fear</strong> because of doubts. All <strong>false</strong> modes of knowing are <strong>transcended</strong>, all the fixated cognition of saá¹sÄra is gone and, thus <strong>nirvÄá¹a</strong>, the state of <strong>complete</strong> buddhahood, is <strong>attained</strong>.</p>
<p>â<strong>All the buddhas throughout the three times fully awaken to unsurpassable, true, complete enlightenment by means of the perfection of wisdom.</strong>â<br/>
In these terms, AvalokiteÅvara lays forth the single cause of fruition, for it is not the case that attainment is uncaused. The <strong>buddhas</strong> of the past, future, and present rely upon the unobservable; they have no object other than the <strong>unsurpassable</strong> state of all the buddhas. They have perfected the <strong>true</strong> teaching and so forth; reached <strong>enlightenment</strong> by purifying the obscurations to omniscience, the personal benefit, and comprehending the essential meaning, the benefit of others; and <strong>fully awaken</strong> within themselves the manifestation of all good qualities.</p>
<p>Then comes the declaration, âÅÄriputra, <strong>therefore, the great mantra of the perfection of wisdom,</strong>â indicating that there is no cause for attainment apart from this one object of focus, this single means of practice, and this final fruition. This is the supreme <strong>wisdom</strong> that has crossed from saá¹sÄra to the other shore. And, this wisdom is called â<strong>the mantra</strong>â; it has five qualities. This wisdom is called âmantraâ since it is self-abiding and does not depend on anything else. The mantra's five qualities are: 1) Since it knows itself by itself, it is <strong>the mantra of great insight</strong>. 2) Since it cannot be recited to others, it is <strong>unsurpassed</strong>. 3) Since it cannot be established as any entity whatsoever, it is <strong>unequal</strong> to all characteristics; and since the essence of all characteristics are its qualities, it is equal to the nature of the inseparable essence. 4) When this heart-essence is realized, it will completely <strong>pacify all sufferings</strong> resulting from mistaken conceptions. 5) Since the mantraâs meaning abides beyond reference, it is <strong>undeceiving</strong> and <strong>should</strong> accordingly <strong>be known as</strong> the <strong>truth</strong>, the very heart-essence.</p>
<p>Thereupon, AvalokiteÅvara <strong>proclaimed this mantra</strong> which encompasses the totality of <strong>the perfection of wisdom</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>TadyathÄ</strong> means âit is like this,â indicating that all things of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a are the same in essence: they are the same in being unobservable, they are the same in being indivisible, and they have the same unchanging nature.</p>
<p><strong>Oá¹</strong> means that whatever appears as the five poisons within the perception of saá¹sÄra, and all that appears as the five buddhas of the five families at the time of fruition, appears only to a mistaken mind and cannot be perceived in reality. </p>
<p><strong>Gate gate</strong>.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> In realizing that wisdom does not abide anywhere else, one has goneâ<strong>gate</strong>âto the other shore and reached fruition for oneâs own benefit. One has likewise also traversed the bhÅ«misâ<strong>gate</strong>âfor the benefit of others.</p>
<p><strong>PÄragate</strong><a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> means that one has reached the highest possible goal for one's own benefit and there is nothing to hope for elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>PÄrasaá¹gate</strong><a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> means that the highest and most exalted benefit of others has been perfected, arising from the compassion focusing on sentient beings. One who has reached perfection in this will manifest as a nirmÄá¹akÄya to those who have purified their karma, and as a saá¹bhogakÄya to those who are of pure nature.</p>
<p><strong>Bodhi</strong> is the quality of unceasing compassion, appearing as the meaning of the perfection of wisdom to beings. </p>
<p><strong>SvÄhÄ</strong> means that minds are naturally liberated. That is to say, they are liberated by their very nature. There is nothing else to seek, no essential instruction other than this.</p>
<p>Therefore, there comes the instruction: â<strong>ÅÄriputra,</strong>â all of you â<strong>should train in the profound perfection of wisdom in this way.</strong>â </p>
<p>â<strong>Thereupon, the Blessed One arose from that absorption and commended AvalokiteÅvara, the bodhisattva and great being: âExcellent!â</strong>â<br/>
Thus we understand that, as soon as AvalokiteÅvara has finished giving the teaching to ÅÄriputra, the Blessed One emerged from the absorption through which he has ripened the assembly and caused the teaching to unfold. He commended AvalokiteÅvara, saying âSince your teaching is the unmistaken sacred Dharma that I have taught, it is <strong>excellent</strong>!
This teaching is <strong>excellent indeed, O son of noble family,</strong> since it is the goal for oneself and also the goal for others. My teaching that the ground, path and fruition are naturally present is this! Noble AvalokiteÅvara, <strong>just as you have taught</strong> to ÅÄriputra, <strong>sentient beings should practice the profound perfection of wisdom,</strong> the primordial wisdom that is inherently present within us.â These are the words directly spoken by the Blessed One. </p>
<p>The next phrase, â<strong>And, then even the tathÄgatas will rejoice,</strong>â indicates that, since the words directly spoken by the Blessed One and the blessed words spoken by AvalokiteÅvara are in accordance, all the <strong>tathÄgatas rejoiced</strong> in this harmonious teaching.</p>
<p>â<strong>When the Blessed One had said this, venerable ÅÄriputra, and noble AvalokiteÅvara, the bodhisattva and great being, together with the whole assembly and the world of gods, human beings, asuras and gandharvas rejoiced.</strong>â<br/>
This description evokes the joy and delight of the entire assembly in the meaning of these harmonious words of Dharma, spoken by the Buddha and his representative noble AvalokiteÅvara. In conclusion, all those gathered thereâthe four retinues, sublime Indra, king of the gods, Vemacitra, king of the asuras, PaÃ±caÅikha, king of the gandharvas and so onâall offered their <strong>praise</strong>.</p>
<p><em>This concludes the commentary by ÅrÄ« Siá¹ha, which is frugal in words and profound in meaning, and which, like the brightest of lamps, revealed to Vairocana the Secret Mantra meaning of the Heart of Wisdom SÅ«tra.</em></p>
<p><em>ÄcÄrya Vairocana later taught this commentary to King Tri Songdetsen and his son, at a time when arrogance had arisen in their minds regarding the practice of the dharma of characteristics.</em><a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a></p>

<p>The term mantra here refers to the scriptures of the tantra. Accordingly, this commentary is an explanation of the Heart SÅ«tra's tantric meaning. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>It appears that the two mothers are the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ, the female deity who is the embodiment of transcendent wisdom, and the Dharma. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>This implies that this sÅ«tra holds the blessing of the three types of sÅ«tras: 1. sÅ«tras spoken directly by the Buddha (<em>zhal nas gsungs paâi bkaâ</em>), 2. sÅ«tras spoken through the blessing of the Buddha (<em>byin gyis brlabs paâi bkaâ</em>), and 3. sÅ«tras spoken through mandate <em>(rjes su gnang baâi bkaâ</em>). <a href="#fnref:3" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Here the author explains the meaning of Blessed One <em>(bhagavat, bcom ldan âdas</em>) by giving an explanation of the individual syllables of the term. For this, the commentary follows the Tibetan order of the syllables and the common Tibetan understanding of the term â as found, for example, in the <em>Two-Volume Lexicon (sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa)</em>. Accordingly, the commentary explains âBlessed Oneâ as one who conquers (<em>bcom</em>), possesses (<em>ldan</em>) and transcends (<em>âdas</em>). <a href="#fnref:4" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Thorough affliction (<em>saá¹kliá¹£á¹­a; kun nas nyon mongs</em>) refers to the state of being dominated by the primary and secondary destructive emotions, which is another way of describing saá¹sÄra. <a href="#fnref:6" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Donald Lopez (1996: 115, fn. 16) has pointed out that the Tibetan term <em>mtshan ma'i chos spyod pa</em>, here translated as âthe dharma of characteristicsâ, could also be a reference to Vairocana giving this teaching at night (<em>mtshan ma</em>) in secrecy. <a href="#fnref:10" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
